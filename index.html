            <hr>
            <p>When you put the miner in a chunk, it randomizes whether or not there will be ore in the chunk as well as the amount of ore that is in that chunk.</p>
            <p>You can put only one miner in a chunk. It does NOT dig ore out of the chunk, it GENERATES it out of nothing. If the ore in the chunk runs out you can simply move it to another chunk where ore will be. You cannot randomize ore simply by breaking and putting a miner because the information about what block generated and "vein" size is stored in the world. For example you put the miner in a chunk and get a gold ore you can't change that by breaking it and putting it in again, you will get gold ore again.</p>
            <p>The miner uses FE energy to do this, so you will need other mods to generate it.</p>
            <p>Every 63 chunks or 1008 blocks from the spawn the amount of ore will be multiplied by a multiplier. You can configure all of this in the config. By default "vein" size randomized between 800 and 2000 blocks multiplied on "multiplier" (by default 1.0 + 0.1 for each 1008 blocks from spawn).</p>
